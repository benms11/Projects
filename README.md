# Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on: 

Note: some of the tables are displayed improperly on Github, and for my third project linked none of the images show up. Please use the nbviewer link if this is the case!

1) My most recent project is a Web Scraping Project where I scrape Brookline property listings from ColdwellBankHomes.com using the Python library Beautiful Soup. I walk the reader through how I found the HTML for each property's information that I wanted and then how I looped it to iterate over six pages's URLs. I then place this info into a Pandas dataframe and make some graphs with it using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

2) The first Python project I did is about Boston Airbnbs. I analyzed an InsideAirbnb.com dataset with Pandas & Matplotlib to gain some insight into the Boston Airbnb market. First I cleaned the data by eliminating the columns I didn't need, then I came up with some research questions and used Pandas to visualize and explore the listing data. Finally, I brought in parallel datasets from Chicago and New York City for comparison. Among other conclusions, I found that Boston is far and away the most expensive for Airbnbs out of the three cities.

3) This is a final paper from an Econometrics class project in Spring 2019, formatted so that it is viewable on Github. Our class used a statistical application called Eviews that is mainly used for time series analysis. The project was to choose a topic with at least 5 independent variables and at least 100 observations for a regression analysis. I chose to study the effect of different NBA team statistics on NBA team wins over four seasons (2014-2018). My main question: how many three pointers is too many in today's pace and space NBA?
