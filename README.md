# Projects
Learning more programming one day at a time. Here are some of the projects I've been working on: 

1) My first project is about Boston Airbnbs. I analyzed an InsideAirbnb.com dataset with Pandas & Matplotlib to gain some insight into the Boston Airbnb market. First I cleaned the data by eliminating the columns I didn't need, then I came up with some research questions and used Pandas to visualize and explore the listing data. Finally, I brought in parallel datasets from Chicago and New York City for comparison. Among other conclusions, I found that Boston is far and away the most expensive for Airbnbs out of the three cities. 

2) My second project is a final paper from an Econometrics class project in Spring 2019, formatted so that it is viewable on Github. Our class used an statistical application called Eviews that is mainly used for time series analysis. The project was to choose a topic with at least 5 independent variables for a regression analysis using Eviews. I chose to study the effect of different NBA team statistics on NBA team wins over four seasons (2014-2018). My main question: how many three pointers is too many in today's pace and space NBA?  
(For some reason, Github has trouble displaying the images in the paper; I've tried everything and nothing works. If they aren't loading for you, please use this link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/benms11/Projects/blob/master/The%203PT%20Era.ipynb). 

3) I'm currently working on a web scraping project that should be posted soon.
