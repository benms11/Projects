# Projects
Here are some of the projects I've been working on: 

1) My first project is about Boston Airbnbs. I analyzed an InsideAirbnb.com dataset with Pandas & Matplotlib to gain some insight into the Boston Airbnb market. First I cleaned the data by eliminating the columns I didn't need, then I came up with some research questions and used Pandas to visualize and explore the listing data. Finally, I brought in parallel datasets from Chicago and New York City for comparison. Among other conclusions, I found that Boston is far and away the most expensive for Airbnbs out of the three cities. 

2) My second project is a final paper from an Econometrics class project in Spring 2019, formatted so that it is viewable on Github. Our class used a statistical application called Eviews that is mainly used for time series analysis. The project was to choose a topic with at least 5 independent variables and at least 100 observations for a regression analysis. I chose to study the effect of different NBA team statistics on NBA team wins over four seasons (2014-2018). My main question: how many three pointers is too many in today's pace and space NBA?  
(For some reason, Github has trouble displaying the images in the paper; I've tried everything and nothing works. If they aren't loading for you, please use this link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/benms11/Projects/blob/master/The%203PT%20Era.ipynb). 

3) I'm currently working on a web scraping project that should be posted soon.
