# Projects
Trying to learn more programming one day at a time. 

1) My first project is about Boston Airbnbs. I analyzed an InsideAirbnb.com dataset with Pandas & Matplotlib. First I cleaned the data, then I came up with some questions and used the Python libraries to visualize and explore the listing data. Finally, I brought in parallel datasets from Chicago and New York City for comparison. I found that Boston is the most expensive for Airbnbs out of the three cities. 

2) My second project is a final paper from an Econometrics class I took my last college semester, formatted so that it is viewable on Github.
